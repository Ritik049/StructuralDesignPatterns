Problem: Suppose we need to make a notification library, intially when are making we have only notify() function, which send only mail at SMS, but we now need to send email notification, social Media notification
*First solution hit in our mind we have a base class and we extend for SMS, email 
  __> Problem in this approach suppose we need to make a several types of it so we again need to make different different classes. which will be very clumsy at programming level.
